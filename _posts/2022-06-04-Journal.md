# Hello, My Name is Gerardo

As I write this on my third day of class, I must say that I am excited, but I do get nervous everyday before class starts. Although, I do hope to land a job in 6 months. In a year from today, I'm hoping to feel comfortable in my new position and continue learning

Everyday in this course I experience some sort of road block, but I make a choir to study 2 hours after class and in the morning. Lachlan has so far made my experience easy. It's hard to say how crazy this class work will get down the road, but he'll definitley be able to make it a somewhat smooth sailing.
